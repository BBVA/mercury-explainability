## Mercury project at BBVA

Mercury is a collaborative library that was developed by the Advanced Analytics community at BBVA. Originally, it was created as an [InnerSource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) project but after some time, we decided to release certain parts of the project as Open Source.
That's the case with the `mercury-explainability` package.
