***mercury-explainability*** is a library with implementations of different state-of-the-art methods in the field of explainability. They are designed to work efficiently and to be easily integrated with the main Machine Learning frameworks.

## Mercury project at BBVA

Mercury is a collaborative library that was developed by the Advanced Analytics community at BBVA. Originally, it was created as an [InnerSource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) project but after some time, we decided to release certain parts of the project as Open Source.
That's the case with the `mercury-explainability` package. 

The basic block of ***mercury-explainability*** is the `Explainer` class. Each one of the explainers in ***mercury-explainability*** offers a different method for explaining your models and often will return an `Explanation` type object containing the result of that particular explainer.

The usage of most of the explainers you will find in this library follows this schema:

```python
from mercury.explainability import ExplainerExample
explainer = ExplainerExample(function_to_explain)
explanation = explainer.explain(dataset)
```

Basically, you simply need to instantiate your desired `Explainer` (note that the above example `ExplainerExample` does not exist)
providing your custom function you desire to get an explanation for, which usually will be your modelâ€™s inference or evaluation function.
These explainers are ready to work efficiently with most of the frameworks you will likely use as a data scientist (yes, included *Spark*).

## User installation

The easiest way to install `mercury-explainability` is using ``pip``:

    pip install -U mercury-explainability

## Help and support 

This library is currently maintained by a dedicated team of data scientists and machine learning engineers from BBVA.
